\f0\b  move the current hero video content down to the body under a new section title, \'91What is Modern AI exactly?\'92.\uc0\u8232 A short snappy title that just explains that you can see a video \u8232 \u8232 here of what what AI essentially is.\u8232 \u8232 2.

\f0\b  make the designs of the real world use cases, look better.

\f0\b\fs30 \cf0 \uc0\u8232 Instead of closing that gap, add a banner image that fits those dimensions tightly without creating more space.

\f0\b The red and green boxes at the bottom where it says traditional and with AI make it look more unique. Those red and green boxes looks very AI like. It's very telling that this was made with AI. I want a more unique design for those two boxes inside.  Perhaps it could follow the same design that we have with all of the other white boxes that has that left stripe, a stripe on the left side. So one could be red and one could be green, but you can also choose another design. To you, it just has to look unique.\uc0\u8232 \u8232  ##3  FREE COURSES TAB\u8232 \u8232 1.

\pard\pardeftab720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs20 \cf0 Step 1: The Gatekeeper (Gmail Settings)
\f3\b0  Even if you pay for the subscription, you must grant permission for Google\'92s AI to read your data.\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\ls1\ilvl0\cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}Open Gmail on your computer.\

{\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}Stay on the "General" tab and scroll down to the section labeled "Smart features and personalization."\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}Check the box for: "Turn on smart features and personalization."\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}Check the second box for: "Turn on smart features and personalization in other Google products."\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\sa240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\ls1\ilvl0\cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}Scroll to the very bottom of the page and click "Save Changes."\
\pard\pardeftab720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf0 Step 2: The Bridge (Gemini Extensions)
\f3\b0  Now you must tell the Gemini chat interface to use that permission.\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\sb240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\ls2\ilvl0\cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}Go to gemini.google.com.\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\ls2\ilvl0\cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}Click on "Settings" (usually a gear icon in the bottom left corner).\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}Select "Extensions."\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}Find the card labeled "Google Workspace" (it includes Drive, Gmail, and Docs).\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\sa240\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\ls2\ilvl0\cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}Toggle the switch to "On."\

\f0\b  You can rewrite that text above if you want but do the research to make sure this is correct\uc0\u8232 \u8232 1.5.1 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0\b  for other AI, for example, make a little note that says this is much better than the internal, because you can use them for all of the applications. Make a dropdown for it if needed be for the box not to change height.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 1.6 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0\b  -in-AI assistance, also add xai_grok and write that the benefit of this is to get real-time user data because it scrapes and looks through x platforms. So if you want opinions, current opinions right now, this is a great tool.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0\b  For everything of these assistants and stuff, if there's a need for a deeper explanation, if the assistant specifically is much more elaborate, then you can do a dropdown for them so that it can explain it only if that is needed for any of them.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0\b Also add openAI chatgpt and explain why it's great compared to the others.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0\b  For Google AI Studio, I need a more in-depth explanation in the subtitle of what it actually is and how it's different from all the others saying, yes, Google has a lot of tools, it's right. They also have something called Google AI Studio, and it's sort of like a middle step between, you know, different things. I need like a proper explanation for what it is because it's very confusing. There are all these tools and then there's Google AI Studio, what is Google AI Studio and when should you use it, for example, and for what and give a little use case in that also, you can make it a drop down.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 2. 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0\b  In AI assistents above \'91Google AI studio\'92 but below the other assistants, place a video there from youtube above Google AI studio you can wrap the box around it if for design it looks better to convey it belongs to google AI studio, with the title above the video (up to you to decide)\uc0\u8232 \u8232 \u8232 3. 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0\b \'92Design & Developer Tools\'92 Add 21st dev and Shadcn for design components under the design and developer tools and explain why they are great.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0\b  Add cloudflare vibeSDK GitHub: \cf2 \ul https://github.com/cloudflare/vibesdk?tab=readme-ov-file\cf0 \ulnone  with a link also to what it looks like saying something like you can very quickly build your own builder that looks like this: \cf2 \ul https://build.cloudflare.dev/\cf0 \ulnone   - Get a cloudflare account and follow this link \cf2 \ul https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/vibesdk\uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f1\b0 \cf0 \ulnone \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0\b Add Openwebui also with an explanation of what it is and why it\'92s great - \'91if you want to build a chat LLM like chatGPT you can use \cf2 \ul https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui\cf0 \ulnone  as the skin instead of building from scratch - you can also run it locally and connect desired LLMS for free and use LMM\'92s without internet connection on your machine.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f3  For Gamme.app have an expandable explanation that explains why it\'92s useful and highlight the difference in presentation/slide making between notebookLM and gamma.app - they might seem similar but used for different things:\uc0\u8232 
\f0\b NotebookLM: When NotebookLM creates slides, it often generates them as "static" visual summaries or simple slides based heavily on your text sources. If you don't like a specific bullet point or want to move an image 5 pixels to the left, it can be frustratingly rigid.\
Gamma: Gamma is built to be edited and can have interactive \'91moving\'92 elements. You can drag-and-drop, change themes instantly, rewrite specific cards, and embed interactive content like videos or websites. It is a full editor, not just a generator. So if you want more control and more advanced slides use gamma.app\
\uc0\u8232 \u8232 4. 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0\b  Move open code and cursor down under AI infrastructure and agents.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 \u8232 
\f1\b0 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f3  add greptile with links to it and explanation of what it is with a dropdown and how it relates to the other tools, example of how to use it\uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f1 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f3  add graphite and how to use it with explanations and why it\'92s gaining popularity among advanced users\uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f1 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f3  add Jules from google with explanation of how to use it.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\f1 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f3  add a combination card at the bottom of AI infrastructure that shows how they can be used in combination some of these infrastructures to create fast autonomous workflows\uc0\u8232 \u8232  
\f1 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f3  For all of the Cards on the AI tools page - if possible I\'92d like favicon/logos for each tool so their original logo\'92s if we can get them if not tell me what I can do to get them - maybe use googles meta data SEO rendering (can\'92t remember what it\'92s called) so instead of our custom png\'92s it\'92s the official logo. Then in the EXANDABLE for the box with explanations on the left side next to the \'91get started button when you expand, our custom PNG\'92s can be inside there\
